## Why VSCode?

#### It's simple

Some IDEs add tons of features, making the interface fairly intimidating for new users. VSCode keeps it more simple--the main page has the toolbar across the top as well as links to help websites. Making a new file is simple, navigating between files is simple, and everything is more beginner friendly.

#### It's full featured

While the main interface is simple, opening up the settings reveals a bevy of additional features. There are settings for most personal preferences (e.g. tabs vs spaces), as well as settings that enable additional quality-of-life features (e.g. diff editor, integrated terminal, and git integration)

#### It's extensible and cross platform

It's available for Linux, Mac, and Windows, so if you work on several platforms, you can have the same experience wherever you go.

That experience can also be improved using extensions! VSCode is an open source project, so it has a crowdsourced extension store, providing extensions for any feature you can probably think of. 

## Useful features and extensions

#### Integrated Terminal

To activate the integrated terminal, type ctrl + `. This opens up a terminal at the bottom of the VSCode window. On Linux and Mac, it will default to bash, while for Windows 10 it will default to Powershell. These can be changed to other shells in the settings, like WSL for Windows. 

#### C/C++

This extension adds debugging and Intellisense support for C and C++. It's developed by Microsoft. Extensions adding Intellisense and debugging for many other languages are also available in the store. 

#### Bracket Pair Colorizer 2

This extensions matches up your bracket pairs and colors them. It's a nice way to add some color to your code while making it easier to read.
