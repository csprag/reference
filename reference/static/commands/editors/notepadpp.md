## Why Notepad++?

#### Plain text editing features

Notepad++ has many text editing features including autosaving, regex finding and replacing, macros, multiple tab functionality, and split screen editing. [Here](https://images.app.goo.gl/AKr4vYyGXZuie1Ej9) is what a typical Notepad++ window looks like while editing a file.

#### Source code editing features

Notepad++ also contains source code editing features including syntax highlighting for about 75 languages and some limited autocompletion features as well. An example of syntax highlighting for cpp can be seen [here](https://images.app.goo.gl/qSUr4XLp3CNgY2Lv5)

#### Plugin support

Many features that are not built into Notepad++ can be found in the library of nearly 150 compatible plugins that allow for extensive functionality while also keeping Notepad++ lightweight for users who do not need them. A list of popular plugins can be found [here](https://dunebook.com/21-notepad-plugins-to-use/). One example plugin is Autosave, a plugin that lets you configure an interval time for autosaving that can help you avoid losing work.

#### Invoking from the command line

Notepad++ can be invoked from the command line if you add the path to the Notepad++ executable to your PATH environment variable. If your executable is located inside the "Program Files (x86)" folder, then you can add Notepad++ to your PATH with the following command inside cmd.exe:

```
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++
```
