# Why Vim? (novice viewpoint)
Vim is designed to be used from a command-line interface
   --> very efficient, easy to open, navigate to, commands and keyboard shortucts, vim is fast
   --> ssh through terminal, vim is usually available, other editors require GUI
Vim is very customizable with plugins, can do anything other editors can do
Open sourced and actively updated
Navigating vim text editor vs. something more modern is a different paradigm / way of coding
   --> way of navigating files that is different than modern editors
