## Why Dev?

#### Designed for C/C++.

It is specifically designed for C/C++, so it makes coding in those languages easier

#### It is an IDE

You can run the program directly in the Dev window without having to run g++ and then run the output of that. 

#### It is exclusively on Windows

Feel superior to your Mac and Linux peers

#### DevPaks

DevPaks are packaged extensions on the programming environment. They include everything from libraries, templates, and utilities. A typical devpak will work with any MinGW distribution (with any IDE for MinGW)
