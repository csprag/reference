Star Wars
-------
<!-- one line explanation would go here -->
This is not actually a command, but a text animation of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope that can be played directly from the terminal.

<!-- minimal example -->
To start the movie, simply type the following:
~~~ bash
$ telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
~~~

---

### Examples of Star Wars
Star Wars uses an ascii text animation broadcasted at towel.blinkenlights.nl to play the movie by telnetting to the server.

'`telnet`' does not come pre-installed when you install linux. To install it on your machine, do the following on Windows or Linux:
~~~ bash
$ sudo apt-get install telnet
~~~

or the following on Mac:
~~~ bash
$ brew install telnet
~~~

Now you can run the command `telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl` to play Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope in your terminal!

* After waiting a few seconds, the ascii text animation will begin in the terminal.
