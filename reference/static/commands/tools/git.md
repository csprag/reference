**git pull**

Git pull combines the two commands 'git fetch' and 'git merge' together to fetch the files from your remote directory then merge them to your current working space. The way you use this command is by going into a functioning git repository and calling git pull. There are some useful tags you can add to it such as adding extra branch tags so for example if you used git pull origin master:dev which would update your local devlopment branch using the remote origin branch master. Another useful flag is when you call git pull --rebase which instead of using git merge to integrate the remote branch with the local branch, it uses git rebase instead.
