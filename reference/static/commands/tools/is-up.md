### Useful Information
Rather than having to navigate to your browser and use a website to figure out if a particular website is down, you can do it straight from your command line! This can be very helpful with web development as it allows you to easily check the status of your website.

`is-up` is not built-in to your terminal and must be installed into your machine in order to use it.

Installation is simple, just do:

~~~bash
$ npm install --global is-up-cli
~~~
